# Bitwise Counter 🧮

### Description
Challenge #1 focuses on bitwise operations and binary reasoning.  
The goal is to count the number of 1-bits in an integer using **only logical and bitwise operators**, without any conversions or external libraries.

---

### 🧠 Objectives
- Understand binary representation of integers.
- Practice bitwise operators in Go.
- Write memory-efficient logic using constant space.

---

### 🧰 Allowed Tools
- Standard library: `fmt`
- Bitwise operators: `&`, `>>`, `^`, `|`, `<<`

---

### 🚫 Disallowed
- Conversions (`strconv`, `fmt.Sprintf`, etc.)
- Slices or strings for binary representation.
- Any non-standard library packages.

---

### 💡 Example
```text
Input:  13
Binary: 1101
Output: 3
```
